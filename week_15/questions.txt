Quick questions:
1.	The XSL family of languages can use a stylesheet to transform an XML
document into an HTML document, which can be displayed by a web browser, with
sophisticated formatting that takes account of the special features of the
information in the XML document. Some web programmers, however, prefer to use a
CSS stylesheet to look after the formatting of the XML document. Why?

-----
Perhaps the primary reason is familiarity - many more programmers know
CSS than XSL, and therefore preffer this technology to unfamiliar methods.
-----

2.Sometimes, you will see an XSL stylesheet whose namespace declaration looks like this:

-----
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl=http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform>
-----

And sometimes you will see an XSL stylesheet whose namespace declaration looks like this:

-----
<xsl:transform version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl=http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform>
-----

What difference does this make to the functioning of the stylesheet?

----
It doesn't make any difference; they are synonymous.

3.	In XSL, what is the difference between "pull" transformations and "push" transformations?
